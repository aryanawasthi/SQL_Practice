which do no have common employees

which do or do not have means?
select first_name,last_name,department_ID,department_name
from employees
Left OUTER JOIN 
departments
using department_id;

11.  
From the following table, write a SQL query to find the 
employees and their managers. These managers do not work
under any manager. Return the first name of the employee
and manager.

We can use LEFT OUTER JOIN on employee to get all the records of people under a
particular manager and manager does notg work under anay manager

select e.first_name,m.first_name
from employees as e
LEFT OUTER JOIN on MANGERS as m
where e.employee_id=m.manager_id [Give all employees whose manager id are present or manager_id are null)
where m.manager_id is NULL;

return the name of manager and employees where managers dont work under any manaagerrs
select e.first_name,select e.first_name from employees where employee id in  t
from employees where employee_id in 
(select employee_id from employees where manaager_id=0) as t

Here The issue is we have to find the name of manager too.

select jh.job_title,d.department_name,conat(e.first_name," ",e.last_name),e.start_data
from departments as d
INNER JOIN jobs as j
using j.department_id=d.department_id
INNER JOIN job_history as jh
on jh.employee_id=e.employee_id
INNER JOIN jobs as j
using jd.job_id=j.job_id
where jd.start_date>="1993-01-01" and jd.end_date<=1997-09-31";

Try to make it more elegant query and always select first table
as one whose fields you have to use to filter.

from employees as e
INNER JOIN jobs as j
using job_id;
[Here The solution used NATURAL Joins but we have selected our columns therefore we dont
reuire new columns.
